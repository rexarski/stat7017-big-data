# STAT7017 Course Material

@Australian National University.

The course notes only contain half of the material covered in a semester (6 out of 12 weeks).

Please forgive me for any typos in the notes since I don't have a spectacular typing speed to keep up all the time.

The project scripts are divided into questions. Some are omitted. Some are hidden inside the overall `.Rmd` file.

For more details, please see [my blog](https://interetro.rbind.io/blog/post/big-data-theoretical-recap/) or my final [report](https://interetro.rbind.io/pdf/big-data-theory.pdf).
